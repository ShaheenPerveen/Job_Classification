# Job_Classification

Practical Machine Learning based approach:
- Prototyped RandomForest and Gaussian Naive Bayes based models for job classification. 
- Used TfIDF Vectorizer and N-gram Count Vectorizer for tokenization of data

Deep Learning Based Approach
- Trained a Recurrent Neural Network(LSTM) coupled with CNN over word embeddings of job description to predict Job Category
